														Dear Fellow Shareholders,
													</p>
													<p class="letter-lg-p">
														In 2013, we completed a plan that advanced our aspirations to be the leading global company in the real estate industry, measured by customer service, employee engagement and financial strength, and that paved the way for meaningful growth—growth supported by the strongest market conditions we have witnessed in a decade.
													</p>

													<p class="letter-title upper">
														Early Completion of a Powerful Plan
													</p>
													<p class="letter-lg-p">
														At completion of our merger in 2011, we established five strategic priorities to strengthen and simplify the new company. Our objectives were designed to make it easier for customers to do business with us and for our team to grow the company, both in profitability and in scale. We gave ourselves 10 quarters to reach our goals. We reached them in eight. 
													</p>
                                                    <p class="letter-title upper" style="font-size: 14px; text-transform: uppercase; font-family: 'Univers LT W01 55 Roman';">

                                                    <p class="letter-lg-p">
														Our plan was to refine the combined portfolio, aligning it with our investment strategy of increased allocation to global markets. We targeted "regional" properties for disposition and worked to exit "other" markets entirely in an orderly, measured approach. At the time of the merger, 79% of the portfolio was allocated to global markets. By year-end 2013, we increased that allocation to 85%, through a series of transactions focused on profitable sales of assets in non-strategic locations with proceeds redeployed into developments and acquisitions in target markets.

														To maximize the productivity of our assets, we needed to increase the occupancy of our portfolio, and put our land bank to work. Our global operations teams delivered outstanding results, leasing a record 152 million square feet of space in 2013. Their efforts drove global occupancy to 95.1% by year-end, with positive rent growth across all continents.<br /><br />
														During the year, we monetized $450 million of land through development starts and third-party sales. We stabilized $1.4 billion of development projects with an estimated value creation margin of more than 30%. While development margins at this level are not sustainable, they do highlight the value of our land bank. Today we estimate the market value of our land is at least 20% greater than its book value.

														At the time of the merger, our combined private capital business was well regarded, but frankly, too complex. Our goal was to reduce the number of investment vehicles, each with a distinct focus, and to increase profitability. Specifically, we worked to create long-duration ventures, open-end funds and geographically focused public entities. These types of vehicles now represent approximately 90% of our investment management revenues, versus 68% at the merger. <br /><br />

														Strengthening our financial position
													</p>
													<p class="letter-lg-p">
														The realignment of our assets played a pivotal role in our ability to build a strong balance sheet. We reduced our look-through leverage, including preferreds, from 50% at the merger to approximately 37% at year end. Looking forward, we expect this metric to further decline. During 2013, our capital markets activity focused on refinancing our unsecured bonds. Our activity lowered our average interest rate by more than 100 basis points to 4.5%, and extended our weighted average maturity to more than six years. We reduced our exposure to foreign currency risk by increasing our U.S. net equity from 45% at the time of the merger to 77% at year-end. This strong financial position enhances our ability to fund our future growth. <br /><br />

														Our fifth objective was to build a highly effective and efficient organization, largely through systems implementations and the elimination of redundancies. Soon after the merger, we reduced our annual operating expenses by $115 million. General and administrative (G&amp;A) expenses as a percentage of assets under management have decreased from 113 basis points at the plan's inception to 69 basis points at year-end 2013.

														A New Company Worth a Fresh Look 
													</p>
													<p class="letter-lg-p">
														Our team has built a strong foundation with the successful completion of our post-merger plan. We have an operating platform of unequaled scale and quality and an inspiring plan for future growth based on the following key elements:<br /><br />
                                                        
                                                        First, we expect significant rent growth over the next four years. We have entered the "sweet spot" of the market cycle. The synchronized improvement we are seeing throughout our portfolio provides real visibility into market conditions. Demand is outpacing supply and is driving vacancy rates below historical lows. Market rents have substantial room to increase, as they remain significantly below replacement-cost-justified rents.<br /><br />
                                                        
                                                        For example, in 2013, U.S. markets had net absorption of 233 million square feet of industrial space—the highest level since 2005. Despite this high level of demand, supply remains quite low. New deliveries totaled just 67 million square feet in 2013—significantly short of the 100 million square feet required each year just to replace obsolete stock.<br /><br />
                                                        
                                                        The gap between supply and demand for space is the widest in history. This imbalance has pushed U.S. market vacancy below prior-cycle lows to 7.2%—well below the long-run historical market norm of 8%. Market conditions are also very strong in Latin America. Mexico continues to see growth both from domestic consumption and export activity. Brazil's largest markets continue to demonstrate strong demand for modern logistics space, given the lack of supply.

														Europe is building on an early-stage recovery with improved year-over-year occupancy and higher effective rents. It is in Asia, however, where we see some of the strongest market conditions. In China, new space requirements from domestic retailers and e-commerce customers pushed portfolio occupancy to 98%. Japan continues to see tightening of vacancy rates and upward pressure on rents, with significant constraints on new development. <br /><br />
                                                        
                                                        Second, we want to use our land bank, development expertise and global customer relationships to create substantial value through development. The key to a successful development program is having strategic land control. In this regard, we are in an excellent position. We have the potential to build approximately 200 million square feet of additional space, or about $10 billion in new development, at high incremental returns on capital. We will be prudent with our development, with starts averaging in the $2.5 billion range annually. We expect the value creation potential on this level of starts will average between $300 million and $400 million a year, across the cycle.<br /><br />
                                                        
                                                        Third, our scale in existing markets allows us to grow with little incremental investment in overhead. Our platform is scaled for profitability, and our assets can grow by at least $10 billion with very small additions to G&amp;A. Our acquisition pipeline is beginning to grow through proprietary opportunities, such as investing in our funds, and as more third-party transactions come to market.

He developed and mentored our global acquisition teams and helped to build a logistics real estate portfolio of unparalleled quality. In Guy's most recent role as chief executive officer, Private Capital, he re-energized our investment management business, enhancing its appeal to investors and its benefit to Prologis shareholders.<br /><br />
